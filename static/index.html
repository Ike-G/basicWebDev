                        <p>Haskell and C# are both compiled languages, and therefore unsuitable 
                            for client-side operations. Haskell is a functional language, and thus
                             its primary use comes in its ability to work without side effects, 
                             making it far more useful in server-side contexts due to its atomicity. 
                             C# is imperative, and therefore does not fit the same mold, but like 
                             other languages in the C family it is advantageous for its proximity 
                             to machine code, making it unsuitable for client-side operations where 
                             processes must be standardised across browsers utilising wildly different 
                             hardware and design patterns. PHP is a scripting language, however it is 
                             used primarily for server-side scripting. Javascript and Typescript are 
                             primarily used for this purpose due to their universal object design 
                             allowing for scripts to be standardised across different browsers by 
                             abstracting out hardware details.</p>

                            multi-agent systems where agents are explicitly equipotent, the client-server
                            model is an instance of a peer-to-peer network wherein many nodes are reliant 
                            on a single node for the performance of a task. In practice, the distinction 
                            exists primarily in that client-server relationships are unidirectional,
                            as the server is minimally reliant on the client, however it should not be
                            forgotten that this remains just a specific convention within a peer-to-peer system.
